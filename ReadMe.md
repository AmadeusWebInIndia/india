india.amws will have a map

it will have states (2 letter code) each as a section, but grouped by region

there will be a jump to pincode in the nav bar

search by state (Google Programmable Search Engine)

each pincode will be it's own repository with an email to control it

this is a social experiment for progressive conscious networks ONLY, final rights of inclusion left to Imran@amadeusweb.com

will include in good faith - truly sincere organisations, movements and people.
